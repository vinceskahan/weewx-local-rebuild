## Rebuild my home weewx setup after weewx is installed

This script installs all my various skins and extensions from github, and should be run after weewx is installed and working (typically - in simulator mode in a VM or on a throwaway Raspberry Pi).  Instructions for what hand-edits to make to weewx.conf for my home 'prod' system are at the bottom of the file.
